Andreas Wilcox personal page
============================

This is the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) source for my personal site where I have my blog and links to my projects. I took a lot of inspiration and code from [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io) and [Scott Chacon](https://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com) to create the site.
