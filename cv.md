## Hi, I'm Andreas Wilcox

      <p>I'm a programmer and enthusiast of all things tech. While I have 14 years experience as a programmer, I also work with 3D modelling, 3D printing and electronics; essentially if I get to be creative I take on most challenges.</p>
    </div>
    <p>I am passionate about learning and enjoy gaining deeper insights or exploring alternative ways of thinking. That often includes trying out new programming languages, game engines, frameworks or tools.</p>
    <p>I'm also meticulous in whatever I do, I push for quality at all times. Though I know from experience that there is a balance you must find between making something great and getting it out the door.</p>

## Clifftop Games
Principal Programmer<br />
May 2020 - May 2025
<br />

### Kathy Rain 2
After Kathy Rain: Director's Cut we started development of the sequel, [Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1466390/Kathy_Rain_2_Soothsayer/). My tasks and technology stack have been similar to KRDC but for KR2 I significantly improved our toolchain. This included more user-friendly asset importering, enhanced search tools, easier content management and various quality-of-life tools. For KR2 I've also focused on VFX such as dynamic lighting, reflections and palette swapping.
<br />

### Kathy Rain: Director's Cut
I was the principal programmer for [Kathy Rain: Director's Cut](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395030/Kathy_Rain_Directors_Cut/), a classical pixel art point & click adventure game made in Unity together with Adventure Creator. I joined the project a few months into development and worked on all aspects related to code; UI, tools, gamepad support, Adventure Creator improvements, etc. But as we're a small team I also did scripting, art asset tweaks, audio implementation and game design.

*Skills: C#, Unity, Adventure Creator, HLSL, Perforce, Jetbrains Rider, Aseprite, Photoshop*
<br />

## Anwilc
In July 2016 I founded my own company for doing consulting work and developing my own games. These are some of the contracts I've had.
<br />

### PubQ
Programmer<br />
December 2017 - October 2019

Developed new features and helped improve their PubQ platform, a system for restaurants to get digital ordering and their own custom app. I developed a new order flow for new customers, implemented a table booking algorithm, redesigned the back-office UI, improved receipt printing and addressed numerous smaller issues.

*Skills: Typescript, Angular, Ionic, Firebase, Git*
<br />

### Mjukvarufabriken
Programmer<br />
August 2018 - January 2019

Subcontracted for a company that sells custom renderings of new building constructions. I maintained their WordPress website and order system, including developing custom PHP solutions. I helped them update existing services and implement new ones to offer to their customers.

*Skills: PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, SVN*
<br />

### CAB Group AB
Programmer<br />
September 2016 - October 2017

Worked on CABAS, a desktop application for insurance companies and workshops to calculate and plan vehicle reparations. A longlived application with a lot of legacy code which was clearly reflected in the number of bugs reported. In addition to general feature development I also spearheaded an effort in implementing an easier workflow for Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and promoted the new workflow within the team.

*Skills: C#, WPF, Microsoft SQL Server, TFS, ATDD, xUnit*
