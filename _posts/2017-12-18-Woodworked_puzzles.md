Giving away something you've made yourself is always an extra joy. As I mentioned in the last post I created a few gifts by hand last christmas, one was the spice rack written in the [previous post](/2017/12/12/Woodworked_spices.html) and the two others were two puzzle cubes I made for my dad.

I found both puzzles, called [half cubes](https://diypuzzles.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/half-cubes/) and [eight cubes](https://diypuzzles.wordpress.com/2015/06/13/eight-cubes/comment-page-1/), online at the great blog [diypuzzles](https://diypuzzles.wordpress.com/). In the first one you just have to figure out how to put them all together to form a complete cube. Easier said than done. The second one requires you to combine the cubes so that the symbols match on each touching cube face.

I built both puzzles in the same size which made things much easier since I could use the same piece of wood for both. So I used a roughly 2cm by 2cm plank, cut up in 2cm cubes for the eight cubes puzzle and slimmer 1cm pieces for the half cubes.

Gluing together the 1cm pieces correctly was a bit tricky, they didn't come out matching together perfectly so I had to sand off a little on some parts. After that they fit together nicely.

The largest timesink though was creating the symbols on the eight cubes. I had decided to burn the wood to create pixel'y symbols but all I had was a normal soldering iron. Pro-tip: a normal soldering iron isn't designed for burning wood. Next time I'm getting a better tool for it.

As you've probably noticed, there is more in the pictures than just the puzzles themselves. I didn't like the fact that it was way too easy to accidentally drop and loose parts. And even if you'd find them all, in the half-cubes case you would still have to re-solve it to even put it back together again.

So I decided to create a holder for both, keeping them in place and something that could look nice as well. The design is all mine, I prototyped a 3D modell first before cutting them out of simple plywood (in two layers in some spots). It has a simple locking mechanism: lift the horizontal bar and slide out the parts from the side. Works just as well as I'd hoped.

It took a few days for both my brother and dad to actually solve the cubes, so they are a bit tricky. But easy enough to create and a great gift!
