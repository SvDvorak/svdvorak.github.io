It's friday and this time I actually have something for you. Left-click in front of the machine to change direction and enjoy your stroll through the virtual city! There's no collision handling currently so it'll just pass through any buildings for now. If you want to be in the rampage mood then I recommend you play [Feuer Frei by Rammstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVYolF1gLIY) while charging through the city. I have only built the web version because it takes a little time to create the other three, if you really want a Win/OSX/Linux-version then tell me on Facebook/Twitter and I'll fix it.

Generating the city mostly works fine, there are some issues with the road connections that I just noticed and haven't had time to fix. Most of the week has gone into making the tiles and it has been surprisingly fun work I must say, planning out and creating small parts of a city. And I'm getting a lot better at using Blender too. The plan for next week is full focus on gameplay for the second part so that you actually can do something other than just walking forwards.

Enjoy and have a great weekend!
