It's friday again! Most of this week has gone into learning about shaders and how to make them but I don't have anything to show for that, though I might write something about what I've learned in another post. But I did fix the city generation bug and I got collision working in the game! So now you can knock over all those trees and crush buildings as you're stomping through the city!

I also added camera shake to amplify the effect, it's mostly noticeable when walking through skyscrapers. Still no music or sound in the game so play something blood-pumping while you're enjoying the destruction.
