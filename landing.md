    - title: Andreas Wilcox
      paragraphs:
        - "Enthusiastic programmer dude who loves game deving it up at all times of the day. And that probably includes a whole bunch of 3D modelling. Though he’s not that good at 2D graphics he’s willing to learn and one day he can be proud of his 2D graphics too!"
        - "And here is another paragraph about him. Isn’t he super dreamy right. For some reason I can’t make a question mark here. That’s weird."

    - title: Programming
      paragraphs:
        - "Here’s a bunch of BS on why I’m the worlds greatest programmer though I’m pretty sure I’m not really that. But I can atleast say that I know a bunch of technologies like
        <ul>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Visual Studio</li>
            <li>Typescript and Javascript</li>
            <li>Docker</li>
        </ul>"
        - "See how important I now seem with all these magical skills. But I don’t really like how it looks with these logos on the side. They might be a bit too big but as you read this it might have already been changed to look super amazingly good."
        - "I’ve worked for a bunch of large companies which should show how skilled and versatile I am. But it might just look like me boasting so who knows. Companies like
        <ul>
            <li>CAB Group</li>
            <li>Atlas Copco</li>
            <li>Emberlink</li>
        </ul>"
        - "Oh, I totally forgot that I do a bunch of my own projects! Like the logos on the right, my Bandcamp search tool and a Leitner Calendar. Should probably talk more about those."

    - title: Game development
      paragraphs:
      - "And now we come to the game dev part where I talk a bunch about the different game projects I’ve worked on. Hopefully they’ll be animated MP4’s but we’ll see what I can do. Pretty much everything is a game jam though since I haven’t actually completed fuck all."
      - "So I’ll talk about on how I’m obviously still a good coder but I also know how to use fancy programs such as Unity, Blender, Photoshop and uhm... not much else really when it comes to games. I mean obviously Visual Studio. But not Unreal Engine, fuck that shit. I’ve been burned several times trying it out and I don’t like it. No matter how fancy stuff looks immediately with their default shaders."
      - "Check out what games I’ve made at itch.io (ADD ITCH)"

    - title: 3D printing
      paragraphs:
      - "Since early 2018 I’ve delved deep into the world of 3D printing, owning my own Original Prusa i3 MK3 printer (ADD PICTURE OF PRINTER STACK)"
      - "I’ve been printing other peoples models but also tweaked existing designs and also created a few of my own designs. As I already know how to do 3D modelling from my game development experience it was a very small step over. And in late 2018 I did a smaller prototype print for a company in Örebro."
      - "I’m open for helping companies both design and print prototypes or limited run items. I can both be part of the design process or just take a modell and print it in whatever material the customers want."
      - "To see several of my own designs and different items I’ve printed check out my Thingiverse page (ADD LINK TO THINGIVERSE-PAGE)."
